# Nutrition Tracker for Kids
This is a console app that makes it fun for kids to keep track of their nutrition.

The app takes care of saving and loading your progress without prompting you for a filename. It uses the name "food.txt", but should you ever need to change the data in that file (for testing or cheating or something), you should know the format in which the data is saved:
1. Date last saved
2. Streak (total of all the days you've logged food)
3. Number of Badges Earned
4. Fruits/Veggies Minimum Servings
5. Grain Minimum Servings
6. Protein Minimum Servings
7. Dairy Minimum Servings
8. Treats Goal
9.-13. Number Of Consumed Servings For Each Food Group, In The Same Order As Before
14. 0 = Fruits/Veggies Bonus Not Complete, 1 = Complete
15. 0 = Grain Bonus Not Complete, 1 = Complete
16. 0 = Protein Bonus Not Complete, 1 = Complete

Everything else is pretty self-explanitory. 

(It may interest you to know there is a menu option (option 4) that explains exactly how you can earn more badges.)
